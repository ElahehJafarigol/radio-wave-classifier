# Introduction
This repository contains code as part of my internship at GSI Technology in 2019. This contains:
* Custom ResNet neural network architecture in Keras 
* Code training a resnet from scratch 
* Code for loading training data
* Code for extracting hamming fingerprints from signal embeddings
* Code for visualizing signal embeddings in t-SNE
